But among the Tiger data points which are collected from GPS, some of the data are in IN instead of IL.

But I will still update the street names for Tiger data in cleaning process for larger size of data. I also audit the postal code of Tiger data, and as I mentioned above, it includes some IN data.

Among these points, user *Umbugbene* contributes 25.74% of data, and top 10 users contributes over half of the data. 47.34% of users contributes only once to the dataset, and they contributes only 4.12% in total.

    "### Solutions\n",
    "The above problems of the OpenStreetMap data could be solved by relying more on GPS data. By introducing the GPS technology, the record of map data will be more complete and accurate. Instead of manually reporting the map data by users, GPS data is more robust and unbiased, especially when users are not familiar with the ways. It will also improve the dataset if specific framework and standard is introduced into the GPS data collection process. However, it is not easy to have access to as much as GPS data on private cell phones and cars - it might raise privacy issue about personal activities. In addition, the interval between each update should be set properly. Using GPS to update the map data might hugely increase the size of the dataset by adding a lot of repeated information to one specific node."
